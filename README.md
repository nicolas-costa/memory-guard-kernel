# Memory Guard Kernel

This is the source of the memoryguard's driver module.
It provides a notification mechanism for the application
to monitor when a new application is opened or an old one is closed
thus allowing the desktop app to maintain it's process list updated.

This was coded back in 2011, when I was learning to code and ended up
with the whole MemoryGuard app idea.
